# LifeScape

## Getting started on local dev:
- Download Expo Go on your Android/IOS device
- Make an account (remember username and password)
- Clone the respository and go to `lifescape-app` directory
- Run `npx expo login` in the terminal
- Login using credentials
- Run `npm i` to install packages
- Run `npx expo start`
- Go to the expo app and scan the QR code on the terminal
- The app should appear on your phone

## Common Errors
**Why does it say expo is in non-interactive mode? I can't run the npx expo login command.**
This is an issue specific to Git Bash. Try using cmd or another unix distro.

**Concerning connecting the expo app from your terminal:**
If the internet connection to your phone is not optimal, you may not be able to connect. Please ensure that your phone is also receiving good connection.
